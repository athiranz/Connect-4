🎮 Connect 4

A modern recreation of the classic Connect 4 game, built using Python, NumPy, and Pygame.
Two players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7×6 board — the first to connect four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

🧩 Features

🟡 Two-player mode (Red vs Yellow)

💡 Win detection system — automatically checks for 4-in-a-row

🧠 Turn-based logic with clear player indicators

🎨 Interactive graphics powered by Pygame

🔁 Option to restart and play again

🧾 Clean, easy-to-read code — great for Python learners

🕹️ How to Play

Run the script:

python connect4.py


Click on a column to drop your piece.

The game ends when a player connects 4 discs in a row.

Press any key to restart the game.

⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
